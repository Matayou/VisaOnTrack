# Production Deployment Checklist

## Development Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any development-only files (e.g., `pages/api/create-test-user.ts`)
- [ ] Check for any lingering test or mock data files
- [ ] Remove any commented-out code or TODO comments

## Email Service Integration
- [ ] Choose and set up an email service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES, or Nodemailer with SMTP)
- [ ] Create an email sending function in `@/lib/email.ts`
- [ ] Update `pages/api/auth/forgot-password.ts` to use the email sending function

## Environment Variables
- [ ] Set up environment variables for production:
  - [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: The URL of your deployed application
  - [ ] Email service credentials (e.g., `EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY`)

## Security
- [ ] Ensure all sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) are stored as environment variables
- [ ] Set up HTTPS for your production server
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API routes, especially for authentication-related endpoints

## Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Implement proper error logging for production (e.g., using a service like Sentry)
- [ ] Remove or disable any development-only console.log statements
- [ ] Set up centralized error tracking and alerting

## Performance
- [ ] Optimize assets (images, CSS, JS) for production
- [ ] Implement caching strategies where appropriate
- [ ] Set up a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets

## Testing
- [ ] Perform thorough testing of all features in a staging environment that mimics production
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Set up automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline

## Database
- [ ] Ensure your production database is properly set up and secured
- [ ] Run any necessary migrations
- [ ] Set up database backups and a recovery plan

## Deployment
- [ ] Choose a hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) if desired
- [ ] Implement a blue-green deployment strategy or similar to minimize downtime

## Monitoring
- [ ] Set up application monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

## Documentation
- [ ] Update any documentation to reflect the production setup
- [ ] Create runbooks for common operational tasks

## Scalability
- [ ] Analyze potential bottlenecks and plan for scalability
- [ ] Consider implementing auto-scaling for your application and database

## Compliance and Legal
- [ ] Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Review and update privacy policy and terms of service

## Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Set up a process for regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Plan for regular review and updates of this checklist

## Development Workarounds Tracking
- [ ] Review and remove any development workarounds or temporary solutions
- [ ] Ensure all TODO comments have been addressed
- [ ] Verify that all features are implemented using production-ready solutions

Remember to go through this checklist thoroughly before deploying to production. Each item is crucial for ensuring a smooth, secure, and efficient production environment.
