  - **See:** `BLOCKER_M1_FE_4_MISSING_PATCH_USERS_ME.md`, `COORDINATION_M1_BE_8_PATCH_USERS_ME.md`, `BLOCKER_RESOLUTION_PATCH_USERS_ME.md`

**Previous Blocker:**
- ✅ **RFC-002 Implementation — RESOLVED**
  - **Problem:** Login page has "Forgot password?" link but no pages exist
  - **Gap:** Missing from spec Section 2, OpenAPI spec, and mockups

  - **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — All reviews approved (Tech Lead, Security Guard, Scope Guardian, PM)
  - **Timeline:** 2-3 days — ✅ COMPLETE (1 day mockups + 1-2 days API implementation)
  - **Impact:** ✅ RESOLVED — M1 password reset flow complete

  - ✅ PM Final Approval: ✅ APPROVED (DoD satisfied for M1)

**RFC-002 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — All reviews approved, ready for M1 deployment

- ✅ All 5 jobs defined per spec Section 14
- ✅ Migration workflow configured separately
- ✅ pnpm workspaces used correctly
- ✅ Environment variables handled securely
- ✅ Workflows follow best practices

**🎉 M0 MILESTONE COMPLETE — All 6 tasks completed and approved**

**RFC-001 Approval (Mockups Prerequisite):**
- ✅ RFC-001 created and approved (Scope Guardian)
- ✅ Problem: Spec Section 2 references HTML mocks that don't exist
- ✅ DoR checklist requires wireframes/mocks before frontend work
- ✅ M1 frontend work blocked without mockups
- ✅ Solution: Create M1 mockups (11 HTML files) before M1
- ✅ Task created: `TASK_M0_MOCKUPS_M1.md`
- ✅ Directory created: `/docs/mockups/`
- ✅ Status: Pending assignment to Frontend Engineer

**RFC-001 Decision:**
> ✅ **APPROVED** — Mockups are required per spec Section 2 and DoR checklist
> 
> **Reason:** RFC-001 addresses a required prerequisite per the spec. Spec Section 2 explicitly references HTML mocks. DoR checklist blocks frontend work without wireframes/mocks. M1 frontend work cannot proceed without these. This is not scope creep—it fulfills a prerequisite already required by the spec. Option A (M1-specific mockups) aligns with MVP focus and unblocks M1 quickly.
> 
> **Timeline Impact:** 1-2 days added before M1 (acceptable for MVP prerequisite)
> 
> **Next Actions:**
> 1. Assign mockup creation task (Frontend Engineer or dedicated designer)
> 2. Create 11 HTML mock files per spec Section 2 routes for M1
> 3. Store in `/docs/mockups/` directory
> 4. Update spec Section 2 links once files are created
> 5. Tech Lead review
> 6. Scope Guardian review
> 7. Unblock M1 frontend work
