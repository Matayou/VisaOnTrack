# VisaOnTrack Docs Guide

Use this map to find the canonical source for each type of information. When creating new material, append to the source listed here (or add a short pointer back to it) instead of spawning another top-level doc.

## Status & Coordination
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` — single source for milestone + program status.
- `docs/tasks/` — **one task file per RFC/feature** is the live status. Example: `docs/tasks/TASK_RFC_004_FE_ONBOARDING_COMPLETION.md`.
- `docs/coordination/COORDINATION_HUB.md` — index of who’s doing what; each entry should point back to its task file.
- `docs/coordination/*review*.md` — supplemental review notes only. Start each with a pointer to the task doc.

## Product Requirements
- `visaontrack-v2-spec.md` — platform-wide spec.
- `docs/user-stories/PROVIDER_DASHBOARD_OVERVIEW.md` — module map.
- `docs/user-stories/PROVIDER_DASHBOARD_USER_STORIES.md` — acceptance criteria.
- `docs/user-stories/PROVIDER_DASHBOARD_CHECKLIST.md` — implementation checklist (acts as DoD for the module).

## Design & Visuals
- Design system documentation will be created in `docs/design/` directory.

## Setup & Ops References
- `docs/setup/TEAM_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS_M1_BE_7.md` — latest backend environment steps.
- `docs/setup/` — other environment runbooks.
- `docs/incidents/`, `docs/blockers/` — only for active issues; archive once resolved.

## Maintenance Rules
1. **Declare the source:** add a blockquote at the top of non-canonical docs linking back to the task/spec they expand on.
2. **Archive instead of duplicating:** move outdated summaries into an `archive/` subfolder (e.g., `docs/mockups/archive/provider-pages/…`) and leave a short stub that points to the live file.
3. **Update the index:** whenever you add a new canonical doc, add it to this guide and to `COORDINATION_HUB.md`.
4. **Prefer sections over files:** extend the relevant task/spec/README instead of creating a separate document unless the content clearly targets a different audience.

Keeping to these rules should keep the docs directory navigable even as more AI agents contribute.
