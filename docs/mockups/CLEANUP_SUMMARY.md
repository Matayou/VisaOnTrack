# Mockups Directory Cleanup Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Action:** Organized elite design system and archived old designs

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created Elite Design System
- Researched Stripe Atlas, Linear, Gusto, Modern Treasury
- Documented world-class patterns in `WORLD_CLASS_PATTERNS.md`
- Created complete design token system in `ELITE_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
- Built 4 elite mockup pages matching industry standards

### 2. Organized Directory Structure

**Current Structure:**
```

├── landing.html                   # ✨ Elite homepage
├── login.html                     # ✨ Elite sign in

### 3. Archived Old Designs
Moved 12 old HTML mockups to `archive/old-designs/`:
- All basic/compact designs
- Old landing, login, register, account-type pages
- Incomplete onboarding pages (seeker, provider)
- Form pages (business details, services, credentials, payment)

### 4. Renamed Elite Files
Removed "-elite" suffix from new designs (they're now the standard):
- `landing-elite.html` → `landing.html`
- `login-elite.html` → `login.html`
- `register-elite.html` → `register.html`
- `account-type-elite.html` → `account-type.html`
- `index-elite.html` → `index.html`

## 📚 Documentation Quality

All documentation now follows world-class standards:
- ✅ Complete design token system
- ✅ Component specifications
- ✅ Accessibility guidelines
- ✅ Animation standards
- ✅ Quality checklist
- ✅ Implementation notes

---

## 🔍 Archive Policy

**Archive files are:**
- Kept for reference/comparison
- NOT for implementation
- Show design evolution
- Demonstrate quality improvement

**To reference old designs:**
1. Navigate to `archive/old-designs/`
2. Open any HTML file
3. Compare with new elite versions

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement elite pages** in React/Vue using design system
2. **Build remaining 8 pages** with elite standards
3. **Review accessibility** with screen readers
4. **Test responsive** at all breakpoints
5. **Performance audit** (Lighthouse)

---

## 📝 Notes

- All elite pages use design tokens (no arbitrary values)
- Animations use Linear's easing: `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`
- Inputs are 44px (touch-friendly)
- Spacing follows 4px grid
- Colors are semantic (#2563eb primary)
- Typography uses Inter font with calculated scale
