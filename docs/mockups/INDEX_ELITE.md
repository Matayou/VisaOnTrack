## ✨ What Makes These "Elite"?

### Typography
- Inter font with proper optical sizing
- Calculated scale (13px, 14px, 15px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
- Perfect line-heights (1.6 body, 1.4 subheads, 1.2 headings)
- Strategic letter-spacing (-0.02em on large headings)

### Spacing
- 4px base unit for precision
- Consistent scale prevents random gaps
- Intentional whitespace creates hierarchy

### Colors
- Semantic, not decorative
- Single primary color (#2563eb)
- Subtle borders (rgba(0,0,0,0.06))
- NO pure black (#0a0a0a instead)

### Animation
- cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) - Linear's easing
- 150ms for micro, 300ms standard, 500ms complex
- Transform over position (GPU accelerated)

### Forms
- 44px touch-friendly inputs
- 3px focus outline with offset
- Real-time validation
- Password strength indicators
- Proper autocomplete attributes

### Micro-interactions
- Hover lift (2px translateY)
- Button press (0.98 scale)
- Smooth color transitions
- Purposeful motion
