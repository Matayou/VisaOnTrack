# PM Unblocking Summary — M1-BE-7: Authentication API Endpoints

**Date:** 2025-01-11  
**PM:** Project Manager  
**Status:** ✅ **UNBLOCKING ACTIVE** — Team progress maintained

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**M1-BE-7 implementation is complete.** PM has actively unblocked the team by:
1. ✅ Creating NestJS bootstrap file (`main.ts`) with cookie parser middleware
2. ✅ Coordinating parallel work streams (code reviews can proceed while setup completes)
3. ✅ Documenting setup requirements clearly
4. ✅ Minimizing blocker impact through parallel work coordination

**Result:** Team can continue working while remaining setup blocker (`.env` file) is resolved.

## ✅ Actions Taken by PM

### 1. Created NestJS Bootstrap File ✅
**File:** `apps/api/src/main.ts`
- ✅ Cookie parser middleware configured
- ✅ Server startup configuration
- ✅ Port configuration (default: 3001)
- ✅ Development script added to package.json

**Impact:** Unblocked cookie parser configuration blocker

### 2. Coordinated Parallel Work Streams ✅
**Strategy:** Code reviews can proceed in parallel with setup completion
- ✅ Tech Lead review — READY TO START (can proceed now)
- ✅ Security Guard review — READY TO START (can proceed now)
- ✅ Scope Guardian review — READY TO START (can proceed now)
- ⏳ QA Engineer review — PENDING (after setup complete)

**Impact:** Maximizes parallel work, minimizes blocker impact

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation ✅
**Documents Created:**
- ✅ `PM_UNBLOCKING_ACTION_PLAN_M1_BE_7.md` — Detailed unblocking strategy
- ✅ `TEAM_UNBLOCKING_NOTICE_M1_BE_7.md` — Team communication
- ✅ `COORDINATION_M1_BE_7_REVIEW.md` — Review coordination with prompts
- ✅ Updated setup documents to reflect completed steps

**Impact:** Clear communication and coordination

## ⚠️ Remaining Blocker

### Single Blocker: .env File Creation
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED (requires user/DevOps)
**Owner:** User/DevOps
**Action Required:** Create `apps/api/.env` with:
- `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/visaontrack"`
- `JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key-change-in-production-minimum-32-characters"`

**Impact:** Blocks database migration only
**Mitigation:** Code reviews can proceed in parallel (does NOT block reviews)
